        <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
        <p1>We are a group of artists with goals to make a living for ourselves and help <br>
            other artists like us to do so too. We facilitate a lot of (both profit and non-profit) <br>
            art programs. We sell our work and also teach both the young and elderly the beauty of art. <br>
            With the money that we make, we help children's hospitals and charities. <br>
            If you want to become a part of this journey, you are welcome to join us!
